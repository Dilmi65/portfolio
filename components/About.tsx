            I&apos;m currently pursuing a Higher National Diploma in Information
            Technology alongside a degree in Psychology &amp; Counselling. That
            combination shapes how I work: I care as much about whether a system
            is usable and well-coordinated as I do about whether it runs.

            On the technical side, I&apos;ve built full-stack applications with

            two-month internship with a government social services department
            have sharpened my communication, coordination, and problem-solving
            skills in real organizational settings.
